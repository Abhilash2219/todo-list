Project Description: To-Do List Application
Overview:
The To-Do List Application is a beginner-friendly project built using React.js. It helps users manage their daily tasks by providing functionalities to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed. This project is designed to introduce you to the fundamental concepts of React, including components, state management, and event handling.

Project Objectives:
Understand React Components: Learn how to break down the user interface into reusable components.
Manage State: Explore how to use the useState hook to manage and update the application's state.
Handle User Inputs: Implement form handling in React and learn how to capture and process user input.
Conditional Rendering: Use conditional rendering to update the UI based on user actions.
Styling React Components: Apply CSS to style components and create a polished user interface.
Features:
Task Addition:

Users can add new tasks by typing into an input field and pressing the "Add" button.
Each task is displayed as an individual item in the list.
Task Deletion:

Users can remove tasks from the list by clicking the "Delete" button associated with each task.
Task Completion:

Users can mark tasks as completed by clicking the "Complete" button.
Completed tasks are visually distinguished (e.g., with a strikethrough or a different color).
Tasks can be marked as incomplete by clicking the "Undo" button.
Visual Feedback:

The UI provides immediate visual feedback as users interact with tasks (e.g., adding, deleting, completing tasks).
Technologies Used:
React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React is used to create components, manage state, and handle events in this project.
JavaScript (ES6+): Modern JavaScript syntax and features are used to build the app, including arrow functions, destructuring, and template literals.
CSS: Basic styling is applied to enhance the appearance of the application.
Project Structure:
App.js: The main component that holds the application's state and manages the overall logic.
TodoForm.js: A form component where users can input new tasks.
TodoList.js: A component that renders the list of tasks.
TodoItem.js: A component that represents an individual task, including options to mark as complete or delete.
Learning Outcomes:
Component-based Architecture: Learn how to design and structure a React application using components.
State Management with useState: Understand how to create and update state in React to reflect changes in the UI.
Event Handling: Gain experience in handling user interactions, such as form submissions and button clicks.
Conditional Rendering: Discover how to render UI elements conditionally based on application state.
CSS Styling: Apply CSS to style components and create an aesthetically pleasing user interface.
